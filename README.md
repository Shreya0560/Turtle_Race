# Turtle_Race 
In this project, users can bet on which of the six color turtles they think will win. The program then utilizes the random module to move each turtle a random distance. The turtle which reaches the other side first is deemed the winner.  This project was created as part of a Udemy Course- 100 Days of Code:The Complete Python Bootcamp for 2022.
